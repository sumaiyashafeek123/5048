NOTE:
I didn't seperate images, css files and js files as because, once i did it, my portfolio become not unresponsive. So, i didn't divide it into folders.
When running externally Like VS Code, please make sure to keep all the images, html files, css files and js files in one place/folder. otherwise it won't responsive.
